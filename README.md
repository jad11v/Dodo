# Dodo


Dodo is a card based react-native application(for iOS) to sort out food plans. 
A user account is currently required, and once conneciton is established each user is given a deck style card view.
  - The card view is a fairly exhaustive list of locations between the users where users have the ability to 'match' on locations.
