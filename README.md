# Dodo


Dodo is a card based react-native application(iOS) to sort out food plans. 
A user account is currently required, and once conneciton is established each user is given a deck style card view.
  - The cards are a fairly exhaustive list of locations between each of the users where users have the ability to 'match' on places between them.
  - Because of api restrictions, the distance between the users has to be less than 15 miles.
